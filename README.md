## Todo List in React 

I created a To-Do List app using React, states, and hooks. The app allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as done, delete tasks, and display tasks in uppercase. I used the useState hook to manage the state of the tasks. 

Each task has a checkbox to mark it as done, a delete button to remove it, and a feature to convert the task text to uppercase. The tasks are dynamically displayed in a list, and the app updates in real-time as tasks are added, completed, or deleted...
